<h1>MongoEbay</h1>

<p>This project is an adaptation of a three-tier E-Commerce architecture such as 'Ebay' using open-source technologies. It makes use of MEAN stack web-development to enhance request handling performance and makes use of messaging service such as RabbitMQ.</p>

<p> This is a completely RESTful API based application and makes use of HTTP protocol.The back-end of this application is built using Node Javascript. The database used is No-SQL which helps in storing product metadata and helps improving scalability of the architecture.</p>

<p> The middleware is built using RabbitMQ messaging service to ensure that no requests are lost and proper subscription and publishing queues are maintained, from where requests are assigned to servers</p>

<p> The front end of this application is built using MVC architecture and coded using Angular Javacript, HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap</p>
<p> The testing was performed using Jmeter to support 100000 concurrent users, Chai and Mocha</p>

<p> This project is built for acamedic purposes and should not be used in any commercial way </p>
